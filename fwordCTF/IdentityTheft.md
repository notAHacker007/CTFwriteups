# Identity theft
```
Someone stole our logo and created a team named "Eword".
In order to find him, I created a fake twitter account (@1337bloggs) to join Eword team.
Fortunately, they replied to the fake account and gave me a task to solve.
So, if I solve it, they will accept me as a team member.
Can you help me in solving the task?
```
So first, we visit https://twitter.com/1337bloggs and find that eword's team twitter handle is @EwordTeam, and that the challenge was on their ctftime website.
We can then use the Wayback machine to find the old version of their ctftime page (https://web.archive.org/web/20200826195056/https://ctftime.org/team/131587)

On this page, we are presented with a link for a pastebin (https://pastebin.com/8bk9qLX1) with contents:

Hi Fred,
 
You said that you are good in OSINT. So, you need to prove your skills to join Eword.
 
Your task:
Find the leader of Eword, then find the flag in one of his social media accounts.
