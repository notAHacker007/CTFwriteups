Something's wrong with this mirror, it's making strange sounds... can you figure out what it's saying?

The md5sum of the flag is: F591C387E3BB9C04375C316F1B6A2548.

Since this is an audio file, and it sounds weird, the spectogram is a good place to start.

Sonic visualizer or [this online tool](https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/) can be used to look at the spectogram.

Putting in the file and hitting play shows this ![](image1.png) ad ![image2.png)
